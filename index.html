    <h1>Joe Average</h1>
    <p>
        <Joe Average sighed, adjusting his tie as he stepped out into the chaos. The salad spinner sunset was in full swing, flinging neon mayo across cloud rinds. He dodged a shoelace comet tripping over a moonbeam hurdle, nearly stumbling into a giggling pothole that seemed eager to swallow his unicycle dreams whole.>

<"Just another Tuesday," Joe muttered, unfazed.>

<He ducked as an origami thunderstorm creased overhead, folding lightning into paper airplanes that zipped past his ears. Freckle constellations migrated across the marshmallow sky, spelling out cosmic gossip he couldn't quite decipher.>

<At the bus stop, a snoring book mumbled bedtime stories to insomniac ink puddled beneath a bench. Joe checked his watch - a hiccupping metronome that conducted symphonies of falling cutlery instead of telling time.>

<The bus arrived, driven by tap-dancing shadows tangoing with moth-eaten spotlights. Joe boarded, finding a seat next to a yawning keyhole exhaling locksmith lullabies.>

<As they passed jellybean beaches where tourists peeled off velcro sunburns, Joe pondered his existence in this perpetually bewildering world. He chuckled, realizing his life was far from average after all.>

<"Maybe," he mused, "being ordinary in an extraordinary universe is its own kind of special.">

<With that thought, Joe relaxed into his seat, ready for whatever absurdity awaited him at the office.>
